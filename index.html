      <p class="intro-paragraph">My name is Karl and over the past couple of years, I've had a realisation. There is so much more to life than a stable job and renting a house. So, I decided to save up some money and set out to see the world...It was the best decision I ever made and I don't think I'll ever look back. This is my little page to share my experiences and hopefully inspire you to do the same!</p>

        <h3>Mexico</h3>
        <p>I spent two wonderful months travelling around Mexico, beginning in January 2023. It was the first time I had travelled solo properly and I met so many amazing people. The country is beautiful all over - the beaches, the food, the culture and the vibe.</p>

        <h3>Thailand</h3>
        <p>The beauty of Thailand cannot be understated. I was lucky enough to spend 2 months here also. Thailand's magic can be seen in the people, the culture of peace and the amazing food. One of my favourite places in the world.</p>
